# About the Project 👩‍💻👨‍💻

<b>A resume is used by job applicants across the globe to to list their background, skills, qualifications and accomplishments. A resume is also usually accompanied by a customized cover letter, which is used to express interest in a specific position at a company while drawing attention to the qualifications that are most relevant to the role on the resume.</b>

<b>A well written resume is one of the most important things for applying to new jobs, internships or externships. People create and design various different projects for showcasing their tech stacks but many would be lost if asked what kind of platform, design or font is best suited to make their resume stand out to potential employers. To help with this problem, I built my current project: Resume Generator. By entering their relevant information on the screen, users will be able to build a modern resume in seconds! </b>
